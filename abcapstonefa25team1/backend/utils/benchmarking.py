def benchmark_function(func, *args, **kwargs):
    """
    Measures execution time for a single function call.

    Args:
    func (callable): The function to benchmark.
    *args: Positional arguments to pass to the function.
    **kwargs: Keyword arguments to pass to the function.

    Returns:
    float: Elapsed time in seconds, rounded to six decimal places.
    """
    start = time.time()
    func(*args, **kwargs)             # Execute the target function with its arguments

def average_benchmark(stmt, setup, number = 10):
    """
    Benchmark using timeit â€” runs code multiple times and returns average time.
    
    Args:
    stmt (str): Code to execute
    setup (str): Setup code executed before running the benchmark.
    number(int, optional): Number of times to run. Defaults to 10.

    Returns:
    float: Average execution time per run in seconds, rounded to six decimal places.
